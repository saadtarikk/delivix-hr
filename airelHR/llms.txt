Project Goal: Replicate the legacy OrangeHRM system using a modern, scalable, and maintainable technology stack.

Core Technology Stack:
- Base Template: next-forge (https://www.next-forge.com/docs)
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router)
- Backend: NestJS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma

Core Modules to Replicate (based on hrms-docs):
- Admin Module
- PIM (Personal Information Management) Module
- User, Roles, and Permissions Module
- Leave Module
- Time & Attendance Module
- Recruitment Module
- Performance Module

The primary source of truth for the legacy system's architecture and data models is the documentation located in the `hrms-docs/` directory. The goal is to follow the patterns and API contracts defined there while implementing them with the modern `next-forge` stack.
