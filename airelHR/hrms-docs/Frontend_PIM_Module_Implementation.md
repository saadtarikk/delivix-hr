# Frontend Deep Dive: PIM Module

This document outlines the frontend implementation details for the Personnel Information Management (PIM) module.

## Core Component: Employee List

The primary user interface for managing employees is a single Vue component responsible for filtering, displaying, and providing entry points for creating and editing employees.

- **Component File:** `orangehrm/src/client/src/orangehrmPimPlugin/pages/employee/Employee.vue`

### Architecture and Design

The component follows modern Vue 3 design patterns, utilizing the Composition API and a component-based architecture.

- **Component-Based UI:** The entire view is constructed from a series of reusable, high-level components from a custom library (`@ohrm/oxd`). This includes components for the search filter container (`oxd-table-filter`), the data table (`oxd-card-table`), and form inputs (`employee-autocomplete`, various dropdowns). This promotes consistency and reusability.
- **Composable Functions:** Stateful logic is extracted into reusable "composable" functions (`usePaginate`, `useSort`). This keeps the main component's code clean, readable, and focused on orchestrating the different pieces.
- **Local State Management:** There is no centralized state management library (like Vuex or Pinia). Instead, component-local state is managed using Vue's `ref` and `computed` utilities. This is a simpler approach that is well-suited for self-contained features like this one.
- **Generic API Service:** A generic `APIService` is used to handle HTTP requests. It is instantiated with the specific endpoint it needs to communicate with, decoupling the component from the low-level details of `axios`.

### Data Flow: Searching for an Employee

The data flow for filtering the employee list is a clear, reactive, one-way loop.

1.  **User Interaction & State Update:** The user interacts with a filter input (e.g., `jobtitle-dropdown`). The `v-model` directive updates a property on the reactive `filters` object within the component's `setup` function.

2.  **Filter Serialization:** A `computed` property named `serializedFilters` is responsible for watching the `filters` object. It transforms the user-friendly filter state into the precise query parameter object required by the backend API. This acts as a translation layer between the frontend's internal state and the backend API contract.

3.  **Reactive API Call:** The `usePaginate` composable is initialized with the `APIService` and the `serializedFilters` computed property. Because `serializedFilters` is a reactive dependency, any change to the filters triggers the composable to automatically execute a new API request to `GET /api/v2/pim/employees` with the newly generated query parameters.

4.  **Data Normalization:** Upon receiving a successful response from the API, the `usePaginate` composable passes the raw data array to a `dataNormalizer` function. This function transforms the backend data model into the view model required by the `oxd-card-table` component. This decouples the view from the API structure and allows for UI-specific data formatting (e.g., concatenating names).

5.  **Re-render:** The normalized data is passed as a `prop` to the `oxd-card-table` component, which then re-renders to display the updated, filtered list of employees to the user.
